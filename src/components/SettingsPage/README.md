## SettingsPage

The `SettingsPage` directory contains the components for rendering the `/settings` page.

For the contents:
* The [SettingsContainer.jsx](https://github.com/cloud-elements/ezra-sample-app/blob/main/src/components/SettingsPage/SettingsContainer.jsx) builds the details needed for the `/settings` page. Likely, this page would only be accessed by an admin in the application and would be a way to access the `application` details or adjust the `branding` for the Cloud Elements' UI.
